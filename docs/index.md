# Scythe

**Scythe** is a lightweight helper library for orchestrating large numbers of simulations using the [Hatchet](https://hatchet.run) distributed task queue.  It focuses on the common pattern of *scatter* (fan out) and *gather* (combine results) while handling artifact uploads, specification validation and result storage.

This documentation contains a brief user guide and an API reference generated from the Python modules in `src/scythe`.
